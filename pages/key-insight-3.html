                <h1>Social Determinants’ Role in an Increased Need for Emergency Health Services</h1>
                <div class="section-one">
                    <p>Public Health and medicine are alike in their goal to help people and make sure they are safe and healthy but are very different in their methods of doing so. As I told my family and friends that I would be pursuing an education in Public Health, I was asked to define Public Health because of the uncertainty and perceived vagueness of the word to those who don’t know about the field. Because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, people were introduced to the term and related policies, such as social distancing and wearing protective masks, that were recommended and put in place by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and WHO (World Health Organization). </p>
                    <p>To begin my education in public health, I enrolled in <strong class="bold">PUBH 302: Introduction to Public Health</strong>, taught by Dr. Bridget Miller. We began to define public health using multiple definitions and ultimately determined to explain it through concepts that work towards promoting health in communities. Please refer to my <a href="../artifacts/Artifact1_Public Health Notes .docx.pdf"><strong>PUBH 302: Introduction to Public Health notes</strong></a> to learn the basics of the field. The goal of public health careers, research, and education efforts is to benefit the health outcomes of communities. These often require health intervention plans, for which many factors must be considered. A key framework every public health student learns is the <strong class="bold">social determinants of health (SDOH)</strong>. SODH are conditions or factors that influence health outcomes and can be subcategorized into micro (individual lifestyle factors such as age, sex, genetics, and beliefs) and macro (socio-economic, cultural, and environmental factors such as water and sanitation, education, employment, access to services, etc.) factors. </p>
                    <p>In class, we analyzed and interpreted different <strong class="bold">SODH factors</strong>. Micro factors cannot be changed while macro factors are based on policies and environmental factors that can be changed through public health efforts. I learned why community members of lower socioeconomic status are affected by poorer health outcomes such as lower sanitation levels, lack of access to gyms and parks, and are often located in food deserts. 
                        With my increasing interest in medicine and public health, I decided to complete an <strong class="bold">EMT certification course</strong> at Greenville Technical College.  To become certified, I completed a series of tests through the course, three 12-hour shifts of ambulance ride-along, a final practical exam, and a final <a href="../artifacts/ArtifactPsychomotorExam.jpg"><strong>EMT Certification Course Notes</strong></a>. All major takeaways from the class are everything I learned during the ride-along. Spending the same amount of time as a full-time job in a classroom becomes tedious and, at times, overwhelming with a challenging and fast-paced curriculum. However, training in the field and understanding what you are training for through first-hand experience makes all the difference. Three years later, I still remember every call we attended. </p>
                    <p>During my first shift, I quickly observed that most calls were taken in response to people of low socio-economic status. I have lived in my hometown my entire life and know most of the areas of town. And, during my first shift, I noticed we mostly received calls from low-income communities. These communities disproportionately require the need of emergency medical services due to systemic barriers. These include limited access to primary care, financial barriers that may dissuade them from earlier treatment due to close concerns, work and time constraints, and lack of health literacy. </p>
                    <p>Though public health efforts cannot change micro-level determinants, macro-determinants adversely affect many individuals who use Emergency Medicine Services. These environments did not have sidewalks, the closest hospital or medical center was farther away than more expensive neighborhoods and were surrounded by mostly gas stations, convenience stores, and fast-food restaurants compared to healthier options. Learning that these hardships and circumstances are so common, especially when I have never been worried that my parents or I could not cover healthcare costs, reminded me why I love public health and the importance of healthcare professions. </p>
                    <p>As I completed the <strong class="bold">Research Pathway of the Graduate with Leadership Distinction</strong>, I had access to published articles and countless resources to supplement my education. Clinical studies, trials, and programs benefit a wide range of communities due to their access to the Internet. I have learned to grow a greater appreciation and respect for clinical studies and medical journals that allow greater access to health education. </p>
                    <p>My post-graduation plans are to go to medical school, and I would like to go somewhere that emphasizes and works toward free medical care to underrepresented individuals. From my knowledge and education in public health, I understand how important prevention is. Physical activity, a healthy diet, and other major disease prevention strategies are the primary prevention methods to stop illnesses and injuries before they occur. However, preventative medicine (including primary and secondary prevention – early detection for diseases to slow progression) is more accessible to individuals who have regular access to healthcare, but individuals who face a lack of access must fall to emergency medical services for their ailments. When emergency medicine is used as primary care, illnesses have usually significantly progressed. </p>
                    <p>While reflecting on my major and beyond the classroom experiences, I have reaffirmed my passion for pursuing a medical career focused on social advocacy, equity, service, and research. I will use my education in public health in my medical profession. </p>
