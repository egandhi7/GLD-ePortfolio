                        My name is Esha Gandhi, and I am a public health major with a business administration
                        minor on the pre-med track at the University of South Carolina, graduating in May of
                        2025. This is my eportfolio for the Graduation with Leadership Distinction (GLD)
                        Research Pathway. This experience has allowed me to reflect and summarize the
                        coursework and experiences I have had over the last four years.

                        As a public health major, I have significantly focused on making a difference to benefit
                        my community. I have completed 2 years of research with the Affect &amp; Cognition Lab.
                        For the first year, I worked and helped on ongoing projects within the lab. I had the
                        opportunity to present at Discover USC in spring of 2024 where I shared a
                        segmentation method for story narratives and collecting affective data. This last year, I
                        have been working on my Honors College Thesis, where I had the opportunity to
                        validate a commonly used tool to collect behavioral ratings of affect by the Affect &amp;
                        Cognition Lab.

                        This eportfolio will take you through my college journey where I showcase how my
                        education at the university has guided me to be an active member in my community and
                        its affects on my Research experience. I plan to continue my education by studying and
                        practicing medicine, where research will continue to be a supplement in my education.
