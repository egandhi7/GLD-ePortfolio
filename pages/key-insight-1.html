                <h1>The Parallels of Social Sciences and Natural Sciences: Gathering Experience and Understanding Ethical Guidelines</h1>
                <p>As I came to the University of South Carolina, I was unsure of what career I wanted to pursue. I always enjoyed science, 
                    math, and social studies classes, subjects I could immerse myself in with hands-on activities, calculate answers, and 
                    learn about the world around me. I was comfortable with learning theories and solving problems, a tool that aided my journey 
                    in research. As a senior, I have pursued the <strong>Research Pathway of the Graduate with Leadership Distinction</strong>, 
                    where I showcase how research has followed me through the last 4 years. </p>
                <p>Before I began my senior thesis, an Honors College requirement, I had to become an expert at applying the concepts I learned by 
                    conducting countless literature reviews, hypothesizing a solution for a problem, and implementing a solution. I decided to 
                    pursue my major in Public Health, for which I was required to take a series of three Health Promotion, Education, and Behavior 
                    (HPEB) classes. In spring of 2023, I enrolled in HPEB 470 Principles of Global Health (my second HPEB class), where I learned 
                    about the driving ethical concepts in research, clinic, public health, and global health settings. In clinical settings, healthcare 
                    teams must practice autonomy (a patient’s right to ultimate authority over decisions about their healthcare), beneficence 
                    (the physician’s responsibility “to do good”), non-maleficence (“to do no harm”), and justice (treating all patients equitably). 
                    In all three HPEB classes, I collaborated with a group to complete an educational and promotional presentation targeted to a high-risk 
                    population group to address a public health problem. In HPEB 470, I created an infographic presentation educating the public about 
                    HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Through the process, I further learned about the stigma towards this public health issue and the importance 
                    of privacy when an individual is diagnosed. The guiding principles I have stated are important for physicians to follow so a patient 
                    feels safe. Through discussions in class, I learned that even among classmates, trust is required to have open conversations that combine 
                    statistics and beliefs, especially when talking about controversial topics, stigmatized issues, and items that are personal for myself and peers. </p>
