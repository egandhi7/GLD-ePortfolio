                <h1>Improving Health Literacy: Preparing High School Students for Healthcare Navigation</h1>
              </section>
              <h2>The Issue</h2>
              <p>
                Personal health literacy is the ability to find, understand, and use health information and
                services for themselves and others (National Institutes of Health, 2025). Health literacy
                is an important skill, though it is often associated with older adults or individuals
                managing a chronic illness. Health Literacy is frequently overlooked as a topic of
                education among high school students, which makes them unsure and overwhelmed
                when making health decisions once they are no longer under their parent’s supervision.
                High school students, especially those in their junior or senior year, should be prepared
                for life after graduation. Since most high school students will either enter the workforce
                or college, they move to cities or states far from home. Regardless of a young adult’s
                choice, they must learn to live independently and manage responsibility for their
                physical and mental health. Most high school curricula do not offer health literacy
                courses nor prepare students to navigate the health care system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inability to navigate the healthcare system can cause fear and stress from not knowing
                when or how to seek healthcare, use and understand health insurance, and advocate
                for themselves and their health in a fast-paced clinical setting. A lack of education in
                navigating health practices can render the students blinded from their preventative and
                mental health resources and their rights as a patient. As these individuals become
                adults, being unprepared to manage health care can negatively affect their health by
                delaying treatment, using the emergency room/departments more often, and having
                overall lower health.
              </p>
              <p>
                Low Health Literacy is caused by the following factors:
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>1.</span> Limited exposure: Most children rely on their guardian to make appointments,
                complete forms and paperwork, and handle payment, because the guardian has
                control over their health decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>2.</span> Lack of education in schools and academic curricula: Health classes at school
                focus on the importance of diet, physical activity, drug prevention, sex education,
                and actions that can affect health practices, but do not include healthcare
                navigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>3.</span> Social media and misinformation: younger individuals tend to be more active on
                social media and turn to it for sources of information, which can often be
                misleading.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>4.</span> Cultural and language barriers: Minorities and first-generation students (and their
                parents) may find barriers in navigating healthcare due to differences in
                understanding terminology and procedures in healthcare.
              </p>
              <p>
                Health literacy studies show that young adults aged 18-25 have the lowest health
                literacy rates that other age groups, and even then, an estimated only 12% of adults in
                America score at a proficient level (Cutilli, 2010). Due to this issue, a plan to educate
                high school students in healthcare literacy must be made.
              </p>
              <h2>Recommendations</h2>
              <p>
                To improve health literacy among high school students, I propose a health literacy
                curriculum to be added to high school junior and senior year classes in the state of
                South Carolina.
              </p>
              <P>
                The curriculum will include the following topics:
              </P>
              <p>
                <span>1.</span> Healthcare system overview: an introduction to different healthcare providers,
                healthcare teams, and specialties (e.g. primary vs. urgent care and the difference
                between physicians, medical assistants, nurses, or physician assistants)
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>2.</span> Health insurance: Terminology (co-pay, in-network, deductible) and
                understanding healthcare bills
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>3.</span> Making and preparing doctor’s appointments: what to bring, what questions to
                ask, what answers to look for
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>4.</span> Patient Rights: consent and HIPPA guidelines, access to health records, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>5.</span> Preventative health and mental health resources: regular testing for high-risk
                illnesses, recognizing when mental health resources may be needed
              </p>                
              <p>
                <span>6.</span> Digital platforms: understanding telehealth and healthcare portals, distinguishing
                between common medical misconceptions
              </p>
              <p>
                The Curriculum would also include a hands-on/activity component where high school
                students can research different clinics around them and which ones they should
                know/have access to. They can work on a project where they evaluate their insurance
                type and make a theoretical appointment with any specialty clinics they would qualify for
                and when they would need to access them. For example, a female high school soccer
                player may investigate the process of making appointments with their primary care
                physicians (for physicals and well-visits), an orthopedic clinic (in case of an injury), and
                a women’s health/gynecology clinic which are all within the network or may take their
                insurance plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, if this program grows to other states, state laws about healthcare that differ will
                also be included in the program.
              </p>
              <h2>Evaluation</h2>
              <p>
                Before and after the health literacy education program is piloted, students will take
                preliminary exams testing what the curriculum will teach. At the end of the course, they
                will take a similar exam to see growth and if the program was successful. Further,
                students will complete feedback surveys and be asked to rate the program, comments
                they have, and other concepts they would like to learn about. Each year, the program
                can be adjusted to make sure the newest information regarding health is taught so that
                the students learn correct and valuable information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, certain colleges and universities in the area can ask students to complete
                health literacy surveys and answer if they believe the program thoroughly and
                adequately prepared them for healthcare navigation.
              </p>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                With a complex healthcare system and misinformation commonly found on social media
                and the internet, high school students will benefit from a health literacy program. This
                will fill an educational gap among many high school graduates including taking care of
                their health and managing the resources and systems to do so. This program will build
                confidence and pave a path for the younger generation to have higher health literacy
                rates and take away the stress that is associated with navigating the healthcare system.
