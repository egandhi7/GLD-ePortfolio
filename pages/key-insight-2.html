                <h1>The Principles of Complementarity and Representations of Physiological Responses to Stimuli</h1>
                <div class="section-one">
                    <p>When learning about bodily processes, it Is important to understand the relationship between the internal processes occurring within the body and external behavior. This connection is especially significant when interpreting a body’s response to stress, emotion, and other stimuli. Understanding this dynamic has aided my <strong class="bold">classwork</strong> and <strong class="bold">research</strong> at the University of South Carolina. </p>
                    <p>The biological processes of the body are complex, especially since they can be studied at a cellular and systemic level. In the fall of 2023, I enrolled in <strong class="bold">EXSC 223: Anatomy and Physiology I</strong>, taught by Dr. Raymond Thompson, where we were foremost taught the four essential concepts present in anatomy and physiology: The <strong class="bold">principle of complementarity</strong>, physiology uses/depends on gradients, regulation of proteins by regulating its shape, and negative feedback loops. Of these four, the principle of complementarity (which states that the function – physiology – is dependent on the form – anatomy) is the most important key takeaway I had. The Sunday before each exam, the students were required to complete a <strong class="bold">Lecture Assignment</strong> where we would answer 4 long answer questions which addressed every topic we had learned, preparing us for the essay portion of the exams. Later in the semester, we learned about the heart, and applying my knowledge of the principle of complementarity aided my understanding of the heart’s atria and ventricles. For every systemic process, I knew that if I could understand the anatomy and see the patterns of function, I could grasp the physiology. For example, the heart has 4 chambers: the right and left atria and the right and left ventricles. When dissecting a heart in Anatomy and Physiology Lab, I noticed that the ventricles are surrounded by more muscle, and the left ventricle more so than the right ventricle. This observation and fact helped me remember that the left ventricle of the heart pumps blood to the entire body (requiring more pressure in pumping the blood) than the right ventricle (which pumps blood to the lungs). </p>
                    <p>As a <strong class="bold">Research Assistant (RA) for the Affect & Cognition Lab</strong>, my responsibilities included running physiology and behavioral data collection, aiding graduate students on tasks they needed completed for their projects and degrees, and creating my own project. My favorite task, of these, was facilitating physiology data collection. One large project and area of study conducted by the Affect & Cognition Lab is studying Misophonia, a condition defined through improper response towards certain sounds. For one branching study, I helped collect physiological data between participants towards aversive and non-aversive stimuli. We would collect physiology responses from electrodes that measured a participant’s electrocardiogram (EG), electromyography (EMG), galvanic skin response (GSR) (also known as electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR) and skin temperature (ST)). Once connecting electrodes on the participant, I asked them to complete a series of tasks for which I would look for the <strong class="bold">appropriate response</strong>  on my screen, where I would see all activity displayed. For EGs, I looked for the PQRST complex, the common heart rate ‘squiggle’ that is captured by recording the heart’s electrical signals and activity. In the graph, the p-wave shows electrical depolarization of the atria, the QRS complex shows deflections of the heart, and the T-wave shows ventricular repolarization – the recovery of the ventricles to pump more blood. If there were any discrepancies in the activity I should see, I could conclude there was an issue with the electrode and reading the physiological responses. When this occurred, I would fix the electrode before the experiment began. </p>
                    <p>Through this experience, I was able to see the structure and the function of the heart, muscles, and other body parts through real-time data. Understanding how these systems worked allowed me to interpret the readings at a basic level and equipped me to avoid capturing inaccurate data due to instrument/electrode error. If I saw significant activity for an EMG, or a ‘fuzzy,’ abnormal reading, I could conclude there was something wrong in the reading process of the electrode, aiding in accurate collection of physiological data. </p>
                    <p>It is important to collect data to the best of the researcher and instrument’s ability so that the results are true. And because of my knowledge in anatomy and physiology, I felt confident in my responsibility of aiding in the collection of physiology data. I was able to hypothesize when a participant would have a certain response when a certain stimulus was presented to them. If I saw the participant frown, cringe, smile, look confused, etc. I could infer what I would see on my screen. On the other hand, I also recognized patterns of activity among patients when I couldn’t directly see it looking at them. For example, if the participant’s skin temperature rose or lowered, I wondered what was causing them to feel that way. </p>
                    <p>Further, I mentioned this was my favorite task. This is because I was able to see the visual representation of a person’s internal state through the measurable physiological activity. As I reflect on my experience, I understand that you cannot completely analyze an individual’s feelings and response by analyzing their facial expressions and body language. However, with research/medical instruments, we can measure and conclude larger issues through their responses to stimuli. During my experience, seeing how instruments can allow for a tangible, visual representation helped me understand the accuracy and put trust in these tools. In my future endeavors, I will have a solid foundation in the understanding of bodily processes to build on through details and more complex interactions. </p>

                        <h3>Artifact 1</h3>
                        <p>This artifact is my first Lecture Assignment for Anatomy and Physiology 1. These Lecture assignments were completed by answering 4 long answer questions about concepts we learned in class, to prepare us for an upcoming exam. I quickly learned these assignments helped me to study and learn all major topics needed for the exam before completing the Lecture assignment, and that I could therefore focus on components I did not completely grasp and had difficulty answering on the assignment. </p>

                        <h3>Artifacts 2 & 3</h3>
                        <p>These artifacts show what I saw on my researcher computer screen while the participant completed the experiment. The top blue graph represents the GSR and the pink graph represents skin temperature. These should have a calm, oscillating graph correlating with the participant’s breathing. As they take a deep breath, the graph will rise, and as they breathe out, the values with lower. The two green lines are representation of the EMGs, measuring the action potentials of the corrugator muscle (EMG A), located above the eyebrow, and the zygomatic muscle (EMG B), located under the cheekbone. When a participant was asked to raise or furrow their eyebrows, large spikes were present. Similarly, activity should be present as a participant smiles, frowns, or any expression that affects that muscle. Lastly, the middle red graph illustrates electrocardiogram activity. The PQRST wave is present. </p>
